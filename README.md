# JavaSim

The simulation framework is a Java-based library designed for building and simulating complex systems. The framework provides a Model class for creating and managing a simulation model, as well as an abstract Component class for defining custom components in the model. Components can be connected to each other using Connection objects, and the framework provides a set of built-in components and connections for common simulation tasks. The framework is highly extensible, allowing developers to create their own custom components and connections to suit their specific simulation needs. The framework can be used in a wide range of applications,
